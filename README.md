A documentation-driven learning platform focused on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics, built to explain how artificial intelligence integrates with real-world robotic systems.

🚀 Project Overview

This project is a documentation website created using Docusaurus, enhanced with Claude CLI and SpeckitPlus to assist with content generation, structuring, and technical explanations.

The goal of this project is to provide clear, structured, and beginner-to-advanced learning material covering Physical AI, robotics fundamentals, and humanoid systems — all presented in a clean, navigable web format.
